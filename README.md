# Financial-Fraud
This Python program includes two scripts for fraud detection. The **fraud_data.py** script processes data, trains machine learning models (Decision Tree, MLP, Random Forest), and saves the best model. The **web_fraud.py** script creates a Flask app that predicts fraud from user input using the pre-trained model, accessible online via Ngrok.
